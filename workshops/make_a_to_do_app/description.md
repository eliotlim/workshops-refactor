In this workshop you'll make a working to-do application that will let you add and remove tasks and mark them as completed. We'll draw on some basic programming skills and see how to structure real-world applications.

We'll also cover:
- How to install the tools you need for practical programming projects
- How to `import` other code that you depend on
