If you've ever wondered what programming is about, heard your friends are coding and want to get into the game or are simply just looking for a chance to learn something new, this is your chance. 
Join us to learn, ask questions and be empowered. 

This workshop will cover:

- Making pieces of code reusable with _functions_
- Storing lists of value with _arrays_
