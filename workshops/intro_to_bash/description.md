If you work with code or data then being comfortable with the command line is essential to your productivity. This workshop will explain and demonstrate the usefulness of the UNIX* shell, Bash.
Weâ€™ll take you through the basics and then show you many useful commands for day-to-day tasks and how to chain commands together using *pipes* and *redirects* (and explain what they are!).

In particular we will cover:
- Basic syntax of a Bash command
- How to find out what commands mean with `man`
- Navigating the filesystem with `ls` and `cd`
- Writing to the filesystem with `touch`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `nano`
- How to get out of a hanging program with ctrl + C
- How to chain commands togather using _pipes_ (`|`) and _redirects_ (`>>`)

*although Bash is a UNIX/POSIX/Linux/macOS thing, it's still something that can come incredibly in handy even on windows!
