  A workshop on installing and configuring Arch Linux.

  In this workshop you'll learn how to get a lightweight Arch system up and
  running, all from the safety of a VM so you're free to make mistakes! This
  will take you from loading up the ISO for the first time to booting into your
  newly-configured OS, and from there the system is your oyster.
